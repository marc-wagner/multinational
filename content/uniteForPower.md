# welcome

we are building a community of humans
who express their wish for a better, more sustainable world

Please pick the topics that are of interest to you.
by doing so, you increase the numbers of members in our community.

we want to reach a critical mass of humans that agree 
on important topics, and once we have sufficient weight,
put the power of our community to use and drive change
in urban, national and world policies.

# unite for power  

do you feel that your life is not going where you want it to,
do you feel that this world is not going where you want it to,
but that you have no power to change anything about it?

do you disagree with your government's decisions?
do you disagree with how this world is run?
but that you have no power to change anything about it?
